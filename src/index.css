/*
background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(126,64,246,1),rgba(80,139,252,1));

This line sets the background of an element to a linear gradient, which is a gradual transition between two or more colors. Here, the gradient goes from left to right (to right). The colors specified in the gradient are represented using RGBA values, which stand for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha (transparency). The first color is rgba(126,64,246,1) (a shade of purple), and the second color is rgba(80,139,252,1) (a shade of blue).

min-height: 100vh;

This line sets the minimum height of the element to 100% of the viewport height (vh). The viewport height is the height of the browser window.

A linear gradient in CSS is a way to create a smooth transition between two or more colors along a straight line. It's often used as a background property to apply color effects to elements on a webpage. The gradient starts with one color and smoothly transitions to another color across the specified direction.
